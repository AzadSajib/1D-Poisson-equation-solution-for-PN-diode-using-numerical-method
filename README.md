# 1D-Poisson-equation-solution-for-PN-diode-using-numerical-method
This is a solution for 1D Poisson equation for a PN diode using numerical approach. The method used here is the Finite Difference method, which is implemented using MATLAB. The boundary conditions (BC) are assumed to be dirichlet BC, and the accuracy of the solution depends on the number of data points taken.
